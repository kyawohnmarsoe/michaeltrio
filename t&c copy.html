                    Product Descriptions</h5>
                <p class="h9">Michael Trio makes all reasonable efforts to display the products listed for sale on its
                    website(s)
                    as accurately as possible. However, the colours we use, as well as the display and colour
                    capabilities of your computer monitor, will affect the colours that you actually see on your screen.
                    Michael Trio cannot guarantee that your monitor's display of any product colour, texture or detail
                    will be accurate. In addition, Michael Trio does not warrant that product descriptions or other
                    content are accurate, complete, reliable current or error-free. While Michael Trio makes every
                    effort to ensure that our products are described and priced accurately, in the event that an item is
                    deemed to be priced incorrectly, Michael Trio reserves the right to refuse sale that item. If a
                    product offered by Michael Trio is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused
                    condition.</p>

                <h5 class="font-weight-normal">Price Changes &amp; Product Availability</h5>
                <p class="h9">At Michael Trio, we aim to keep our prices as competitive and fair as possible, in order
                    to pass the
                    savings onto our valued customers. However, the prices of our diamonds, gold and other precious
                    stones and metals are aligned very closely with the international market rates and standards.
                    Michael Trio reserves the right to adjust our prices accordingly as deemed fit. Therefore, the price
                    of an item may be updated without prior notice. At Michael Trio, we seek to maintain a balance
                    between storing our product stock and reducing our inventory listings. Therefore some of our popular
                    products may be sold out and may take up to 4 weeks to be available, depending on the processing
                    lead time required from our manufacturing department. Should you encounter any product(s) that you
                    are interested in but is deemed as unavailable, you may contact us at service@michaeltrio.com to
                    check on the soonest available period.
