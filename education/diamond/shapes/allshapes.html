                                                    The Asscher Cut Diamond, also called a "Square
                                                    Emerald-Cut", is made using a step-cut process and has
                                                    cropped corners. Because of the cropped corners, an
                                                    Asscher Cut Diamond appears almost octagonal at first
                                                    glance. They are bright, shiny, and clear in appearance.
                                                    Like Emerald-Cut Diamonds, they have the clarity of
                                                    glacier-water ice, allowing you to see all the way through

                                                    naked eye with Asscher Cut Diamonds, it is important to

                                                    The Round Diamond, or Brilliant Cut Diamond, is by far the
                                                    most popular shape for diamond engagement rings. It is
                                                    cone-shaped to maximize light return through the top of
                                                    the diamond. It is cut to have 58 facets: 33 on the crown
                                                    and 25 on the pavilion. The relationship between the angle
                                                    of the crown (above the girdle) and the pavilion (below
                                                    the girdle) is complementary. A steep crown angle is
                                                    complemented by a shallower pavilion angle, and vice
                                                    versa.

                                                    The Cushion Cut Diamond is an antique cut that has a
                                                    classic, romantic appeal. It is considered a cross between
                                                    the Old Mine Cut, which was popular in the late 19th and
                                                    early 20th centuries, and a modern Oval-Cut Diamond. The
                                                    Old Mine Cut featured large facets and rounded corners,
                                                    since the cutting was all done by hand at the time. They
                                                    were designed to catch the beauty of candlelight. The
                                                    Cushion-Cut Diamond contains 58 facets.

                                                <p>
                                                    The Emerald-Cut Diamond is a very popular style known for
                                                    its beauty and precision. While it lacks the brilliance of
                                                    diamonds cut with triangular and kite-shaped facets, it
                                                    more than makes up for it in its extreme clarity – it’s
                                                    like looking into glacier-pure ice. The Emerald-Cut
                                                    diamond is named so because this style of cut was
                                                    originally used only on emeralds. It is called a step-cut,
                                                    which is the cut most commonly used on square or
                                                    rectangular diamonds.

                                                <p>
                                                    The Heart Shaped Diamond has a cleft at the top and
                                                    exhibits superior brilliance. It is among the most
                                                    romantic of the diamond shapes. When selecting a heart
                                                    shaped diamond, symmetry is essential, as the two halves
                                                    of the heart must be identical. The split between the two
                                                    lobes should be obvious and sharp, and the wings should
                                                    have a round shape. Generally, heart shapes diamonds of
                                                    less than .50 carats are not a good choice. As opposed to
                                                    other diamond shapes, they appear smaller, especially
                                                    after set in prongs. Bezel and three prong settings are
                                                    best for small heart shaped diamonds.

                                                    The Marquise-Cut Diamond is a boat-shaped brilliant stone
                                                    that is considered to be a "classic" shape for diamond
                                                    engagement rings. As with all 'fancy cut' diamonds, color
                                                    and clarity are the two most important qualities in this
                                                    particular style of cut. The Marquise-Cut Diamond uses a
                                                    cutting process similar to that of a Round Brilliant
                                                    Diamond, but the diamond cutter maximizes the carat weight
                                                    of the gem by elongating it into its distinctive
                                                    ''boat-shape''. This way, they can eliminate all
                                                    inclusions while maintaining as much of the unblemished
                                                    stone as possible. However, because of the elongated
                                                    shape, color and clarity imperfections are more obvious
                                                    than they are in a traditional Round Brilliant Diamonds.

                                                    The Oval Cut Diamond is a modified version of the most
                                                    popular cut, the Round Brilliant. It is the perfect choice
                                                    for buyers who are looking for characteristics similar to
                                                    the Round "Ideal" Cut, but would like something in a shape
                                                    that is more unusual. Oval Cut diamonds also create the
                                                    optical illusion of length and serve to elegantly elongate

                                                    create an unusual diamond that can still make light
                                                    'dance' as it does in the traditional Round Brilliant Cut.
                                                    It is probably the most subjective diamond shape, as its
                                                    size and proportions are really a matter of taste. The
                                                    diamond usually contains 58 facets, allowing for light to
                                                    pass through it much the same way as in a Round, but makes
                                                    more of an impression because of its much less common
                                                    shape.

                                                    traditional Round Cut. It combines two diamond cutting
                                                    styles-the Round Cut style and the Emerald Cut style, to
